## Notes

- Setup these notes
- Installed zotero plugins
- 1st Run
	- One device (The host) can detect the peer and launch the first part of the lab, but the second device never registers a peer, and does not advance
	- Logs![[dev_4_1 1.txt]]![[dev_9_1.txt]]
- Work
	- Going to try to add some more trace log calls around the lab startup to better track what is getting executed
	- Going to do some extra Transmission Wait UI initialization so that it indicates if it has never found a peer.
- 2nd Run
	- I added some code to change the button text to "wait for peers" before any peers were found, but it already says "wait for host"
	- Both devices now do not see each other as peers, bot h  showing 0 and wait for host
	- The both call Initialize(), ConnectToTransmission(), then handleOldestPeerUpdated(), then nothing.
		- No peer address in the oldest peer updated, meaning no oldest peer was detected
	- Logs![[dev_4_2.txt]]![[dev_9_2.txt]]
- I wonder if the device itself is tracked in the peers list, checking
- Changing Transmission wait UI setup
- Should add a test to check if our network address is included in the list of peers and ages
```C#
Transmission.Instance.Peers.Contains(NetworkUtilities.MyAddress);
```
