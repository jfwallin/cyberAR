This is a very simple way of using the editor in game mode to create or edit a "Big JSON"

-------------------------------------------------------
If you want to make a new JSON:

The path variable should contain a string to the folder you want the JSON located in.
	note that this must end in a / 

The name variable is the name of the JSON file

The New Json option should be checked

Other fields should be filled out approprietly

Once everything is set, hit play and then stop. JSON will be created at the end.

------------------------------------------------------
If you want to edit an existing JSON:

The path variable should contain the path to the JSON you want to edit.
	(You can get this by right clicking a JSON file and selecting "copy path")

The new JSON option should not be checked

Hit play.

You should see the JSON apear in the inspecter.
Edit it as you need.

Stop play. The JSON should be edited.
